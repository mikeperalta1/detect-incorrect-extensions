# Mike's Incorrect Extension Detector

A simple program to detect which files have file extensions that probably don't match their contents.

## Requirements

* Python3
* pipenv

## Installation

Before running inside pipenv, you probably want to ask pipenv to install your dependencies. Navigate to the project directory and execute:

```bash
pipenv install
```

## Usage

Some instructions and examples for how to use this program.

### Invoking via PipEnv Shell

Invoke a pipenv shell by cd'ing to the project directory and executing:

```bash
pipenv shell
```

From there you can run the program normally like:

```bash
python main.py --help
```

### Invoking via PipEnv Run

CD to the project directory and run:

```bash
pipenv run python main.py --help
```

### Command Line Arguments

The best way to see all available arguments is to run the program with the ***--help*** argument.
